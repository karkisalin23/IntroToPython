# Chapter 3 Notes

1) String - a sequence of characters enclosed within either single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (''' ''', """ """).

    ex: 
        single quotes --> a = 'Hello'
        double quotes --> b = "Hello"
        triple quotes --> c = '''Hello''' or """Hello"""

2) String Slicing - process of extracting a portion of a string by specifying a range of indices.

    ex:
        name = "H e l l o"  --> length 5
                0 1 2 3 4
